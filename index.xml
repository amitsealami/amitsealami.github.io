      <description>Hello there!
I am Amit, a faculty member of University of Dhaka (DU), and I teach at Institute of Information Technology, the pioneering software engineering Institute of Bangladesh. I have completed both my BSc. in IT (Major in Sodftware Engineering) and MSc. in Software Engineering from the same Institute in year 2012 and 2014 respectively. As student, I participated, achieved accolades in, organized, and mentored many different competitions and workshops, such as Microsoft Imagine Cup Bangladesh, Microsoft App-a-Thon, BASIS Code Warriors&amp;rsquo; Bangladesh and BUET System Design and Development Contest.</description>
