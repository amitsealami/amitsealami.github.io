Because why not, right? Everyone loves tinkering around the reviewing process instead of actually reviewing, so … there.</p>

<p>Turns out that it is fairly simple to do this programmatically using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">python</code> these days. You need a PyPi packaged called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pypdf2</code> package before, and a template style cornell page that you can generate from <a href="https://incompetech.com/graphpaper/cornelllined/">here</a>.</p>

<p>You are golden at this point. Here are the steps:</p>

My goals were simple when making this,</p>

<p>a) learn Python as a programming language and</p>

<p>b) solve a pain point for me.</p>

<p>Turns out that my pain point is also a pain point for other people!</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/qEdo7DK.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Somehow, it gained attention from nice people across the Internet. It got featured in <a href="https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2017/05/adjust-external-monitor-brightness-ubuntu">OMG Ubuntu</a>, people suggested it on Reddit, and some suggested that it should be <a href="https://pointieststick.com/2021/09/10/this-week-in-kde-a-random-grab-bag-collection-of-stuff/">integrated into KDE</a> by Default or at least they should make something similar. <a href="https://github.com/LordAmit/Brightness/graphs/contributors">Collaborators</a> joined in and helped make Brightness Controller way better than ever possible and helped make this available across Ubuntu PPA, Arch Linux AUR, and more. Just from PPA alone, Brightness Controller has been downloaded about <a href="https://ppa-stats.sheth.io/#/?ppaName=brightness-controller&amp;ppaOwner=apandada1&amp;packageName=brightness-controller">160K times</a>! For all these, I am grateful.</p>

<h2 id="future-of-brightness-controller">Future of Brightness Controller</h2>

<p>People still email me about ideas, suggestions, and new features - such as 1) keyboard shortcuts, 2) setting brightness based on a preset on start-up, 3) making it adjust brightness and color temperature automatically like f.lux or Redshift, 4) making it not be overwritten by f.lux or redshift and 5) finally - making it compatible with Wayland.</p>

<p>Of these, some of them are possible (1-3), and some of them are technically impossible or simply out of my hand (4 and 5). Many of them are good to have.
Indeed, I receive new pull requests implementing new features sometimes. However, progress has slowed down due to the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I use a Macbook for work purposes these days, so even if I can check and run code. Even though PyQt works cross-platform, I can not test the actual Brightness Controlling function enabled by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">xrandr</code>, the backend. It does not work anywhere except Linux, as far as I know.</li>
  <li>More importantly, I have way more on my hands than before!</li>
</ul>

<p>It seems like someone else will have to take up the mantle to do it! 😅</p>

<p>Indeed, I fixed several weird, silly bugs last weekend and completely changed the structure of the project to make it more future-proof when it comes to packaging and publishing. Before that, the last major change happened over a year ago. But that’s okay - Brightness Controller was built with several key design principles in mind. It does not do much, but whatever it is supposed to do, does it well, hopefully.</p>

<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h2>

<p>I am a believer in <em>Less is more</em> and <em>Separation of Concern</em> concepts when it comes to designing and programming.</p>

<p><strong>Separation of Concern (SoC)</strong>: I tried to make sure I follow them when making Brightness Controller. If you look at the code, you will probably notice that it is badly written, long, verbose, and does not follow OOP that well. But it still follows SoC, which has helped me maintain the code base for the last decade. Therefore, if you write code, make sure you follow this principle. 😉</p>

<p><strong>Less is More</strong>: The reason why Brightness Controller works is that it is created to contain no nonsense. I could’ve tried to force in lots of fancy functionalities over time. Do you know what that would mean? More Bugs! No one wants that. Hence, making it simple is better in the long run!</p>

<p><strong>Third Party APIS is a Pain</strong>: Things keep changing outside the scope of Brightness Controller. For example, Wayland will possibly replace <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">xrandr</code>-supported displays soon in Linux entirely, and I do not see anything at this point that can be used as the backend for Brightness Controller in Wayland.</p>

<p><strong>If It ain’t Broken, Don’t Fix it</strong>: Self-explanatory, to be honest. 😉</p>

<p>Anyway, that’s all I wanted to talk about. Have fun people.</p>

<p>Brightness Controller will always be free. Free as in free beer, and free from any type of data tracking whatsoever. Heck, I have no way of knowing how many people are using it right now. It solved my problem, and I hope it solved yours too and <em>gave your eyes some relief</em>.</p>]]></content><author><name>Amit Seal Ami</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[9 Years of Brightness Controller - Experience, Gratitude and Lessons Learned']]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://i.imgur.com/wiz4ZKv.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://i.imgur.com/wiz4ZKv.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry xml:lang="en"><title type="html">Submitting to IEEE/ACM conferences - Lessons Learned</title><link href="https://amitsealami.com/blog/2022/08/29/submitting-to-ieee-acm-conferences-lessons-learned/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Submitting to IEEE/ACM conferences - Lessons Learned" /><published>2022-08-29T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-08-29T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://amitsealami.com/blog/2022/08/29/submitting-to-ieee-acm-conferences-lessons-learned</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://amitsealami.com/blog/2022/08/29/submitting-to-ieee-acm-conferences-lessons-learned/"><![CDATA[<p><em>[Reposting from my old blog site]</em></p>

<p>Recently I faced a few problems for a paper written using ACM conference template. The problems were related to Bibliography, IEEE PDF eXpress and Bookmarks! Here are the details and how I solved them with the help of different materials available across the Internet.</p>

<h2 id="problem-1-referencing-online-websites-in-bibliography">Problem 1: Referencing Online Websites in Bibliography</h2>

<p>Luckily this was solved in <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/bibtex-formatting">ACM Author Guideline</a>. As mentioned in their website, the structure should be:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@online</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">Thornburg01</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="na">author</span> <span class="p">=</span><span class="s">{Harry Thornburg}</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="na">year</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="s">{2001}</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="na">title</span> <span class="p">=</span><span class="s">{Introduction to Bayesian Statistics}</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="na">url</span> <span class="p">=</span><span class="s">{http://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/bayes/bayes.html}</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="na">month</span> <span class="p">=</span><span class="s">{mar}</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="na">lastaccessed</span> <span class="p">=</span><span class="s">{March 2, 2005}</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<h2 id="problem-2-url-too-long-and-crosses-references-margin">Problem 2: URL too long and crosses references margin</h2>

<p>For dual column papers, the URL references may be too long, thus ending up crossing the column margin. In ideal scenario, the URL should break to the next line without crossing the margin. To achieve so, I followed instructions from <a href="https://norwied.wordpress.com/2012/07/10/how-to-break-long-urls-in-bibtex/">blog</a>. In short, these packages should be included like so:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span class="k">\usepackage</span><span class="p">{</span>url<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="k">\usepackage</span><span class="p">{</span>breakurl<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="k">\usepackage</span><span class="na">[breaklinks]</span><span class="p">{</span>hyperref<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Sometimes URL contains many dashes ‘-‘ , so he took care of it like so:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span class="k">\def\UrlBreaks</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="k">\do\/\do</span>-<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>As a result, the URL will be broken at an appropriate ‘-‘ when necessary.</p>

<h2 id="problem-3-ieee-pdf-express-checking-failed-due-to-bookmarks-hyperlinks-and-external-hyperlinks">Problem 3: IEEE PDF eXpress checking failed Due to Bookmarks, Hyperlinks and External Hyperlinks</h2>

<p>Well, this was a awkward problem, since I was using the default ACM conference template provided through Overleaf. By default, the template produces PDF files which contain bookmarks. Additionally, each citation becomes hyperlink to references! Whats more, in case the references are to online resources, those references become External Hyperlinks! After digging around, I found the <a href="https://latex.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=69905&amp;sid=94e5b9fd689f20b1ca8c6f57c0e406e4#p69905">answer by Stefan</a> is useful. Particularly, these two options worked for me:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex">  <span class="k">\PassOptionsToPackage</span><span class="p">{</span>draft<span class="p">}{</span>hyperref<span class="p">}</span>
  <span class="k">\hypersetup</span><span class="p">{</span>draft<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Otherwise, the failsafe approach is to use the combination of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pdf2ps</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ps2pdf</code>. For example,</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">  pdf2ps paper.pdf
  ps2pdf paper.ps</code></pre></figure>

<p>This should convert the PDF to PostScript at first, later converting it to PDF again while removing all annotations and bookmarks in the process. Please note that the size of the converted PDF may not match with the original PDF. However, it should still be acceptable to IEEE PDF eXpress.</p>

<p>Good luck with your submissions!</p>]]></content><author><name>Amit Seal Ami</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently I faced a few problems for a paper written using ACM conference template.

Rigorous evaluation? Creative Solutions? Something else entirely?</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/FDE2cCZ.png" alt="" /></p>

<!-- more -->
<p>I recently came across a short paper by Jennifer Rexford and Scott Shenkerand titled “Answering three questions about networking research” that addresses those questions.</p>

<p>I noticed that the concepts discussed in that paper are similar to what I’ve learned as (sub) reviewer. I’ve been sub-reviewing research papers of several Security and Software Engineering venues, such as NDSS, ICSE, USENIX Security, TOSEM, ASE, and FSE, guided by my advisors Dr. Adwait Nadkarni and Dr. Denys Poshyvanyk for the past few years and picked up what to look for, and what not to focus on during reviews.</p>

<p>Next, I raised the following questions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>can I extract and map the properties of good research papers according to this article and my current understanding?</li>
  <li>How do I map the inter-woven relations of these properties in a easily understandable way without repeating texts?</li>
</ol>

<p>I came across the concept of concept mapping recently (see what I did there? Yes? Anyway … ). I am a fan of the mind map technique, and have used it a lot. The concept map technique is similar while labeling relations and following a hierarchical structure.</p>

<p>Based on my understanding, I created the concept map that describes the properties of a good research paper, from the perspective of reviewers.</p>

<p>Does this concept map address the questions I’ve raised, i.e., extracting properties and mapping relations in an easy to understandeable manner?</p>

<p>আমেরিকায় আমি গবেষণা করছি এবং পিএইচডির পিছনে ছুটছি প্রায় বছর চারেক হচ্ছে। এসময়ে আমি ফেসবুক, ইন্সটাগ্রাম জাতীয় সামাজিক মাধ্যমে দেশি বিদেশি খুব কম সহশিক্ষার্থী আর গবেষকদের একটিভ থাকতে দেখেছি। কারণটা খুব সহজ: গবেষণা করতে একাগ্রতা লাগে, মনোযোগ লাগে, লাগে একনাগাড়ে লেগে থাকা।</p>

<p>আমরা যারা কম্পিউটার সায়েন্সের গবেষণায় আছি - তারা আরো ভালো জানি, ফেসবুক এবং এ জাতীয় সকল মাধ্যমগুলো বিশাল পরিমাণে বিনিয়োগ করে তাদের সিস্টেমে। সেই সিস্টেম প্রতিটা মানুষকে তার পছন্দের কনটেন্ট, ভিডিও ইত্যাদি দেখায়, যেন ব্যবহারকারী আরো মনোযোগ দেয়, আরো সময় দেয়, আরো আরো আরো বেশি জড়িয়ে যায় এসবে।</p>

<p>সমস্যা হচ্ছে এগুলো ব্যবহার করার অভ্যাস আপনার মগজেও পরিবর্তন ঘটায়। কীভাবে এগুলো পাকাপোক্তভাবে আপনার একাগ্রতা নষ্ট করে দেয়, মনোযোগের সময় কমিয়ে আনে এগুলো নিয়ে বিস্তর গবেষণা আছে, হচ্ছে, হবে - সেগুলো নিয়ে আপনি পড়তে পারেন বা শুনতে পারেন অনেক যায়গাতেই। ড: কাল্ নিউপোর্ট, কম্পিউটার সায়েন্স গবেষক, এর <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3E7hkPZ-HTk">একটা ভিডিও</a> বক্তব্য আপনারা শুনতে পারেন যেখানে উনি ফেসবুক জাতীয় মিডিয়াগুলো কীভাবে মানসিক ক্ষতি করে সে বিষয়ে সংক্ষিপ্ত আলাপ করেছেন। ১০টা মিনিট খরচ করে এটা দেখেন, জীবনের কাজে লাগবে অবশ্যই।</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ফেসবুক ফেলাইতে পারবো না, সারাদিন মেডিটেশনও সম্ভব না!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>মিডিয়ার খারাপ দিক নিয়ে, মনোযোগ অনুশীলন নিয়ে বেশিরভাগ কনটেন্ট যা আছে সেগুলো আমাদের দেশের জন্য প্রযোজ্য না বা প্রয়োগ করাও কঠিন। যেমন কেউ আমাকে যদি বলে ফেসবুক ডিএকটিভ করে ফেলেন - আমি তারে চোখ উল্টায়ে বলবো অসম্ভব! আমার বাবা মা দেশে থাকে, আত্মীয় স্বজনও নানা দেশে, বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ের শিক্ষকদের গ্রুপও ফেসবুকে। সেখানে নানা জরুরী খবর মাঝে মাঝেই থাকে। না পেলে আমারই তো ক্ষতি! তার উপর ফেসবুক ছিলো বলে আমি সময়মতো জানতে পেরেছি <a href="https://amitsealami.com/blog/2021/12/14/Traveling-Bangladesh-Omicron/">হুট করে বাংলাদেশের নিয়ম পাল্টেছিলো ওমিক্রনের জন্য</a> - ফেসবুক না থাকলে দেশে আসার পরে তো আমার বউসহ ১৪ দিন কোয়ারান্টাইনে থাকা লাগতো নিজ খরচে। ক্যামনে কী!?</p>

<p>সুতরাং আমি আলাপ করবো আমি নিজে যা করি মনোযোগ আর একাগ্রতা ধরে রাখতে - ফেসবুক সহ নানা সোশ্যাল মিডিয়াতে থেকে, সাদা কালোর মাঝের ছাই রঙা এই পৃথিবীতে। আপনি হয়তো সবগুলো হুবহু করতে পারবেন না, হয়তো আরো বেশি করতে পারবেন।</p>

<p>এই গাইডলাইনটা থাকলো - আপনার আমার রেফারেন্সের জন্য।</p>

<h2 id="যেভাবে-আমি-মনোযোগ-এবং-একাগ্রতা-অনুশীলন-করি">যেভাবে আমি মনোযোগ এবং একাগ্রতা অনুশীলন করি</h2>

<p>সবার আগে আপনার আমার একটা জিনিষ বুঝা দরকার। আমি বড় হয়ে গেছি, সুতরাং আমাকে আমার নিজের দায়িত্ব নিতে হবে। আগের মতো বকাঝকা করে কেউ আমাকে নিয়ন্ত্রন করবে না বা লাইনে আনবে না। কিন্তু নিজের দায়িত্ব নেয়া অবশ্যই কঠিন। সেটার জন্য আমি কিছু সফটওয়্যারের আর প্র্যাকটিসের সাহায্য নিয়েছি যেন সেগুলো আমার দায়িত্ব নেয়, আমাকে লাইনে রাখে। কিন্তু নিজেই যদি সেই সফটওয়্যার ফেলায়ে দেই বা অফ করে দেই, তাহলে তো আর লাভ নাই। সুতরাং, আগে নিজের সেটআপ করা সফটওয়্যারের প্রতি বা প্র্যাকটিসের প্রতি নিজের কমিটমেন্ট সবার আগে আনতে হবে।</p>

<p>এইটুকু মনে রেখে আমি পরের কাজগুলো করি।</p>

<h3 id="পুশ-মেথড-বাদ-দিয়ে-পুল-মেথডে-আসুন">পুশ মেথড বাদ দিয়ে পুল মেথডে আসুন</h3>

<p>প্রথমেই আপনার যেটা বুঝতে হবে সেটা হচ্ছে এটেনশন নেবার এবং আনস্মার্ট বানানোর সবচেয়ে সহজ মাধ্যম হলো আপনার পকেটের স্মার্ট ডিভাইসটা। এই ডিভাইসটা রাত দিন আপনাকে নোটিফিকেশন পুশ করে (বা ঠেলে) এটেনশন নিয়ে নেয়। আমি পুল (বা নিজে টেনে নেবার) মেথডে নিয়ে এসেছি এটা। কীরকম?</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>ফেসবুক</strong>: আমি মোবাইলে ফেসবুকের অ্যাপ ফেলেই দেই সেমিস্টার শুরু হলে কারণ এটা আমার সবচেয়ে বেশি মনোযোগ নেয়। এই ছুটির সময় অ্যাপ ইন্সটল করেছি এখন কোন কাজ নাই এজন্য। বিদেশ যাবো, অ্যাপ ফেলে দিবো। তবে ম্যাসেঞ্জারটা রেখেছি - কারো কোন জরুরী দরকার হলে কল দিতে পারে। ফেসবুক ব্যবহার করতে ইচ্ছা করলে ব্রাউজার চালাই - তবে সেটায় আরো কিছু কেরামতি করেছি। পড়তে থাকুন, বলছি।</li>
  <li><strong>অন্যান্য অ্যাপ</strong>: আর যেসব অ্যাপ থাকে (যেমন টুইটার - এটা একেডেমিশিয়ানরা অনেকেই ব্যবহার করে, আমি প্রায়ই নানা গবেষণার সন্ধান পাই এটা থেকে) সেগুলোর নোটিফিকেশন সাইলেন্ট থাকে মোবাইলে। কিচ্ছু আসে না বা শব্দ করে না। ফ্লোটিং নোটিফিকেশন তো আরো আগেই অফ! এন্ড্রয়েডে আপনি এটা কনফিগার করতে পারেন চাইলেই অ্যাপের সেটিংস থেকে বা <a href="https://support.google.com/android/answer/9079661?hl=en#zippy=%2Cchange-notifications-for-your-phone%2Cturn-notifications-on-or-off-for-certain-apps">নোটিফিকেশন সেটিংস</a> থেকে। ট্যাগ টুগ দিলে তাও নোটিফিকেশন আসে - কিন্তু সেটা মাসেও একবার নাকি সন্দেহ। নিজের যখন ইচ্ছা হয়, ঢুকি, তারপর আবার বার হয়ে যাই।</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="সময়-নিয়ন্ত্রিত-ভাবে-মিডিয়াতে-দেয়া">সময় নিয়ন্ত্রিত ভাবে মিডিয়াতে দেয়া</h3>

<p>ভ্যাজাল হচ্ছে ছোটবেলায় বাবা মা খুব বেশি সময় টিভি দেখলে বকাঝকা দিয়ে উঠিয়ে দিতো। বড় হবার পরে সোশ্যাল মিডিয়ার জন্য সেটা কে করবে? এ্যালার্ম দিতে আলসেমি লাগে, আবার সবসময় তো ঘড়ি ধরে দেখাও যায় না। তাই না?</p>

<p>দেখাচ্ছি ক্যামনে করি:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>ব্রাউজার প্রোফাইল</strong>: ব্রাউজারে আমার দুইটা প্রোফাইল। একটা কাজের, আরেকটা অকাজের। কাজের প্রোফাইলে আবার অকাজের কোন সাইটে আমি লগইন ই করি নাই। সুতরাং চাইলেও ওটা থেকে আমি অকাজের সাইটে সময় দিতে পারবো না। ক্রোম ব্রাউজারে প্রোফাইল সেটআপ করার জন্য এই <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2364824?hl=en&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop">অফিশিয়াল গাইডলাইন</a> দেখতে পারেন। <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-remove-switch-firefox-profiles">ফায়ারফক্স</a> বা অন্য ব্রাউজারেও একই সুবিধা আছে। ব্রাউজারে না পারলে নিজের কম্পিউটারে দুইটা ইউজার বানিয়ে ফেলেন!</li>
  <li><strong>সময় নিয়ন্ত্রন</strong>: অকাজেরটায় আবার <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stayfocusd/laankejkbhbdhmipfmgcngdelahlfoji/related?hl=en">StayoFocusd</a> নামের একটা এক্সটেনশন ইন্সটল করেছি। আপনিও পারবেন ক্রোম বা এ জাতীয় ব্রাউজারে এটা ইন্সটল করতে। ফায়ারফক্সের জন্যও একই রকম অ্যাপ বা এক্সটেনশন আছে। এটায় আমি কনফিগারেশন করে রেখেছি এভাবে: সারাদিনে আমি যখনই ফেসবুক বা অন্য ব্ল্যাকলিস্টেড সাইট চালাই - এটা সবগুলো সাইট মিলিয়ে আমাকে সর্বমোট ১০ মিনিট দেখতে দিবে। সুতরাং হয়তো আমি ফেসবুক চালাবো ৫ মিনিট, ইন্সটাগ্রাম চালাবো ৫ মিনিট। এর বেশি হলে সারাদিনের জন্য ঐসব সাইট ব্লকড হয়ে যাবে নিজে নিজেই।</li>
  <li><strong>আনইন্সটল ব্লক করা</strong>: যদি নেহাৎ এমন অবস্থা হয় যে আপনি নিজেকে নিজেই নিয়ন্ত্রন করতে পারেন না, দুমদাম সব আনইন্সটল করে ব্রাউজ করতে চান; সেক্ষেত্রে একটা ফ্রি অ্যাপ আছে, <a href="https://getcoldturkey.com/features/">Cold Turkey</a> যেটা আনইন্সটল করাও ব্লক করে দেয়। আরো কিছু অ্যাপ আছে যেগুলো কিনতে হয় টাকা দিয়ে। এটা দিয়ে চেষ্টা করতে পারেন। তবে তার আগে ভেবে দেখবেন, আপনি যদি নিজেই নিজের ভবিষ্যৎ সত্ত্বাকে আটকাতে না পারেন, অ্যাপগুলো কি পারবে?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="pomodoro-আর-নিজেকে-মনিটর-করা">Pomodoro আর নিজেকে মনিটর করা</h3>

<p><strong>Pomodoro</strong>: আমি পোমোডোরো টেকনিকের ভক্ত। যে কাজ করতে ভাল্লাগে না সে কাজ একমনে জন্য পোমোডোরো কাজে দেয় আমার; আর যে কাজ করা দরকার, ভাল্লাগে সেগুলো তো করার জন্য পোমোডোরো লাগে না। করতেই থাকি, করতেই থাকি!</p>

<p>খুব সহজে বললে পোমোডোরো টেকনিক এভাবে প্রয়োগ করি আমি:</p>

<ol>
  <li>কাজটা কী ঠিক করি</li>
  <li>স্টপ ওয়াচ বা টাইমার নিয়ে বসি (না থাকলে <a href="https://pomofocus.io/">ব্রাউজারেই</a> আছে; অথবা মোবাইলে <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cc.forestapp">Forest</a>)</li>
  <li>২৫ মিনিট একাগ্র চিত্তে, একমনে অন্য কিছু না করে খালি ঐ কাজটাই করি</li>
  <li>৫ মিনিট বিরতি - এসময়ে ফেসবুক বা অন্য যা মন চায় করতে পারি</li>
  <li>আবারো ২৫ মিনিট কাজ</li>
  <li>আবারো ৫ মিনিট বিরতি</li>
  <li>আবারো ২৫ মিনিট কাজ</li>
  <li>এবার ১৫ মিনিট বিরতি</li>
  <li>এক নাম্বার স্টেপ থেকে আবারো</li>
</ol>

<p>এমন না যে ঠিক ২৫ মিনিটই কাজ করতে হবে। হয়তো কাজটা মাঝে থামানো যাবে না এজন্য ৩০ মিনিট করতে হতেই পারে! কিন্তু ৫ মিনিট বিরতি মানে ৫ মিনিটই, এর বেশি এক সেকেন্ডও না। আমি টাইমারের টিক্ টিক্ ঘড়ির শব্দটা শুনি। আগে থেকেই এভাবে টিক্ টিক্ শব্দের মাঝে কাজের অভ্যাস বলে শব্দটা শুনলেই নিজে নিজে কাজ করার মানসিকতা চলে আসে।</p>

<p><strong>নিজেকে মনিটর করা</strong>: আমি অনেক সময় মন অস্থির থাকলে পাশে একটা কাগজ কলম রাখি। কাজের মাঝে অন্য কিছু করলে বা ভাবলেই কাগজে লিখে ফেলি সেটা কী।  তারপরে আবার আগের কাজে ফেরত আসি। লিখলে কয়েকটা কাজ হয় -</p>

<p>১) সচেতন হই, নিজের মনোযোগ আবার কাজের বিষয়ে নিয়ে আসতে পারি;</p>

<p>২) সেটা যদি আসলেই কাজের কাজ হয় তাহলে আর মনে করা লাগে না। লেখাটা পড়ে কাজটা করে ফেলি; আর</p>

<p>৩) মনোযোগ কীসে চলে যাচ্ছে সেটা লিখিত আকারে থাকে। সপ্তাহ বা মাস শেষে সেগুলো দেখে আরো পদক্ষেপ নিতে পারি যেন আমার কাজে এগুলো ঝামেলা না করে।</p>

<p>এগুলো ছাড়াও আমি দুইটা জিনিষ সব সময় মনে রাখি বা মানার চেষ্টা করি:</p>

<h3 id="বিশ্রাম-মানে-বিশ্রাম-সোশ্যাল-মিডিয়া-ঘাঁটানো-না">বিশ্রাম মানে বিশ্রাম! সোশ্যাল মিডিয়া ঘাঁটানো না</h3>

<p>দেখেন, অনেকের ধারণা দিনশেষে একটু মোবাইল গুঁতালে, মিডিয়া ঘাটলে মানসিক শান্তি লাগে, বিশ্রাম হয়। ব্যাপারটা তা না। আপনি কাজের সময়ও যেমন তথ্য নিচ্ছেন, আর সেগুলো মানসিক ভাবে বিশ্লেষন করে ক্লান্ত হচ্ছেন - ফেসবুক ঘাটার সময়েও তাই। খালি আপনার ভাল্লাগে বলে টের পান না, যদিও ভিতরে ভিতরে ঠিকই অস্থিরতা বাড়ে, বাড়ে মানসিক পরিশ্রমও।</p>

<p>একারণেই আমার সারাদিনে (বিশ্রাম + কাজের) মাঝে সর্বমোট বরাদ্দ সময় ৪০ মিনিট ফেসবুক এবং অন্য মিডিয়া মিলিয়ে। কারণটা খুব সহজ। দিনশেষে আমি যখন মানসিক ভাবে ক্লান্ত আমি তখন চুপচাপ বসে থাকবো, চিন্তা করবো, গল্প করবো, বা হয়তো বই পড়বো। এগুলোর প্রতিটা আমার নিয়ন্ত্রনে: আমি কতক্ষন করবো। ফেসবুক বা মিডিয়া সেটা ধরে রাখার চেষ্টা করবে। কিছু জিনিষ দেখাবে যেগুলো আমার ভালো লাগবে, কিছু আমাকে দুঃচিন্তা দিবে, কিছু রাগাবে। কিন্তু সেগুলোর নিয়ন্ত্রন আমার হাতে নাই।</p>

<h3 id="সোশ্যাল-মিডিয়া-ছাড়া-সময়-কাটানো-যায়">সোশ্যাল মিডিয়া ছাড়া সময় কাটানো যায়</h3>

<p>সোশ্যাল মিডিয়ার বয়স ২০ বছরও হয়তো হবে কোনমতে। খালি খ্রিষ্টিয় বছর গোনার হিসাবেই মানবজাতির ইতিহাস ২০০০+ বছর। তখন মানুষ সময় কাটাতে পারতো, এখনো পারে। আমিও পারবো। খালি দরকার একটু চেষ্টা, একটু সদিচ্ছা (আর উপরের সবগুলো কাজ করা)। সবসময় সময় কাটানো লাগবে এমনও তো না! কী হয় একটু বিশ্রাম নিলে? একটু নিজের জগতে সময় দিলে? আমার নিজেরই লাভ হবে তাতে।</p>

<h2 id="শেষ-কথা">শেষ কথা</h2>

<p>দিনশেষে অনুশীলন অভ্যাসের বিষয়। আপনি ছোটবেলায় হাঁটতে পারতেন না, সেটা অনুশীলন করে শিখেছেন। এখন আমাকে ৫ কিমিঃ দৌঁড়াতে বললে আমি ১ কিমিঃও হয়তো দৌঁড়াতে পারবো না, হাঁপিয়ে যাবো - কারণ অনুশীলন নাই। একাগ্রতা, মনোযোগ এগুলোও অনুশীলনের বিষয়, খাদ্যাভাস এর মতোই।</p>

<p>এগুলো প্রথম দিন থেকেই হুট করে হবে না, আর আপনি সারাদিনে ২০ মিনিট মেডিটেশন করে একাগ্রতার অভ্যাস করলে সেটা বাকি ১২ ঘন্টা যে অমনোযোগী থাকেন সেটাও ঠিক করবে না। এগুলো আপনার সারাদিনই করা লাগবে, সবসময়ই।</p>

<p>প্রিয় পাঠক/পাঠিকা, হয়তো এগুলোর সবগুলোই আপনি করেন। হয়তো আপনার পরিস্থিতি এমন যে এগুলো করা সম্ভব না। বা হয়তো কোনটা কোনটা আপনি করেন, কোনটা করেন না, পছ্ন্দ না বলে। আমি জানতে চাই, আলাপ করতে চাই এসব নিয়ে। অপেক্ষায় রইলাম আপনার মন্তব্য, প্রশ্নের, সমালোচনার - হোক সেটা এই ব্লগেই, বা ফেসবুকে, বা অন্যখানে।</p>

<p>একাগ্রতার অনুশীলনে আপনার জন্য শুভকামনা। :sunflower:</p>]]></content><author><name>Amit Seal Ami</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[কেউ আমাকে যদি বলে ফেসবুক ডিএকটিভ করে ফেলেন - আমি তারে চোখ উল্টায়ে বলবো অসম্ভব!]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://amitsealami.com/blog/images/default_bn.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://amitsealami.com/blog/images/default_bn.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry xml:lang="en"><title type="html">Traveling to Bangladesh during Omicron Covid: A Tale of Mismanaged Restrictions</title><link href="https://amitsealami.com/blog/2021/12/14/Traveling-Bangladesh-Omicron/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Traveling to Bangladesh during Omicron Covid: A Tale of Mismanaged Restrictions" /><published>2021-12-14T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-12-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://amitsealami.com/blog/2021/12/14/Traveling-Bangladesh-Omicron</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://amitsealami.com/blog/2021/12/14/Traveling-Bangladesh-Omicron/"><![CDATA[<p>The travel regulations <strong>before December</strong> stated 2 conditions: any traveler needs to have 1. double shot of vaccines, and 2. a negative covid result from a test administered within <strong>72 hours before the flight</strong> to avoid getting quarantined. In almost every other nation that’s doable if you consider antigen-testing, or PCR testing, including the USA. Everything checked out for us, and we scheduled PCR Test at CVS Pharmacy. CVS Pharmacy was recommended by almost everyone I knew due to their consistent turnaround time: <a href="https://cvshealth.com/covid-19/testing-information#drive-thru-testing">48-72 hours on average</a>.</p>

<p>Lady Luck had something else in store for us.</p>

<p>At 2AM in US time on the day we were supposed to be tested (December 3rd), we found out that Bangladesh started requiring <a href="https://m.facebook.com/AirportMagistrates/photos/a.691289464302727/4507937399304562/?type=3&amp;source=57">“Covid-negative PCR test result possession for all incoming flight passengers”</a>, within <strong>48 hours before the flight</strong> because of the Omicron variant.</p>

<p>We were <strong>VERY</strong> <strong>CONFUSED</strong>.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>1st, this was apparently declared a couple of days ago, but we found about it much later. I kept checking for travel advisories from Bangladesh and Qatar Airways for the last few days continuously, so I should’ve noticed this earlier. Comments by other Bangladeshis in the Facebook post and the page revealed that this circular was not updated to Civil Aviation Authority Bangladesh’s website even on Dec 3rd, 11:15 AM Bangladesh time, which explains why I did not notice this earlier.</p>

<p>2nd, this is seriously problematic for International Arrivals in Bangladesh during Winter holidays, in particular from the USA, for several reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Only Relying on PCR Tests</strong>: While other countries like <a href="https://www.lufthansa.com/be/en/corona-tests">Germany accepts PCR/Antigen tests</a>, Bangladesh only accepts PCR test. Note that Antigen test results are made available within several hours, while PCR tests generally require 48-72 hours.</li>
  <li><strong>Inconclusive Results from Test</strong>: CVSPharmacy is consistent when returning results within 48 hours, yes - but the result itself can be inconclusive. In fact, a Bangladeshi I know tested Inconclusive in PCR test for 2 days in a row and had to rely on antigen test for travel.</li>
  <li><strong>Lack of Test Slots</strong>: CVSPharmacy and any other pharmacy have fixed slots for Covid tests per day and if you do not schedule in advance, you either a) won’t get test slots that can give you results in 48 hours before the flight, or b) you will get test slots that can not give you results within the 48 hours time range.</li>
  <li><strong>Lack of Very Rapid PCR Test Labs</strong>: Rapid PCR test results come out in 48-72 hours on average. However, some Test Labs/Centers can give you results within <strong>2-3 hours</strong> instead of Very Rapid PCR Test Labs, in exchange for a very high cost (rapid PCR tests generally cost nothing) since they analyze the samples themselves. The problem is, the USA is <strong>BIG</strong> and <strong>Scattered</strong>. The commonwealth (or you can read it as “state” ) I am in, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia">Virginia</a>, is almost as big as Bangladesh (110K sqKM vs 148K sqKM), and it is only 35th largest. Depending on the area you are in, you may or may not have access to such labs. You may have to drive for several hours, and they may or may not test you depending on whether it is a weekend, whether they have a slot, etc. Do remember that it is the winter holidays season. If you don’t have a car, then it is even worse. Public transport in the USA is bad.</li>
  <li><strong>Very Rapid PCR Labs Are closed on Weekends</strong>: Our flight was on a Sunday, so we had to be tested either by Friday or Saturday. Some labs offer half-day service only on Saturday and remain closed till Monday.</li>
  <li><strong>Influx of Customers</strong>: The 48-72 hours turnaround time from CVSPharmacy assumes that there is no sudden surge of customers. And guess what? December is the holiday season, therefore a surge of customers can happen at any time because they will be traveling.</li>
</ol>

<p>In short, this decision came suddenly with no time for travelers to prepare, and with unrealistic expectations. That’s not just me, you can look at the confused comments from soon-to-be-travelers in <a href="https://m.facebook.com/AirportMagistrates/photos/a.691289464302727/4507937399304562/?type=3&amp;source=57">Magistrates All Airports of Bangladesh</a> page as well. In case you are wondering if we can travel to Bangladesh and “bargain” about our entry, we won’t even get the boarding pass for the flight if we do not satisfy these requirements.</p>

<p>We had to frantically search for Very Rapid PCR Test Lab locations and finally found a lab on Saturday. It cost us <strong>300USD per test</strong>, while results are provided in <strong>around 1 hour</strong>. After that, we were able to travel - although exhausted and annoyed at the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh.</p>

<p>Were these new restrictions necessary? Absolutely! Bangladesh took the right steps to reduce the Omicron spread.</p>

<p>However, the execution itself was flawed. Bangladesh should’ve:</p>

<ol>
  <li>spread the declaration across websites and aviation companies as soon as it became available, and</li>

<p>(<em>Note that I am entirely ignoring the … rather unpleasant nature of the responses from Magistrates there. In fact, I am grateful because if they did not go out of their way to share this as soon as they got this, we would’ve never known about this in time.</em>)</p>

<p>Will Bangladesh change how it handles such things, maybe in the future?</p>

<p>I am … not sure. Doing things the right way requires empathy, far-sightedness, and multi-cultural understanding. I don’t think many of the officers possess those qualities. After all, if they did, these problems won’t have arisen in the first place.</p>

<p>But one can only hope.</p>

<h2 id="বিমানবন্দর">বিমানবন্দর</h2>

<p>বিমানবন্দর নিয়ে সবার খুব ভয় - কাস্টমস এর জন্য, আরো কী না কী! আমার অভিজ্ঞতা বলি - বিমানবন্দরে নেমেছি সকাল ৯টায়, বার হয়েছি ২টার দিকে সব শেষ করে। এত সময় লাগলো কেন? ৩ বা সাড়ে ৩ ঘন্টা লেগেছে কভিডের পিসিআর নেগেটিভ টেস্ট দেখাতে, ১ বা ১.৫সট ঘন্টা লেগেছে তারপর ইমিগ্রেশনে। এত সময় লেগেছে কারণ ঐদিন আমাদের ফ্লাইটের সাথে আরো ৪টা ফ্লাইট নেমেছে, সবগুলো মিডল ইস্ট থেকে, খেটে খাওয়া বাঙ্গালিদের নিয়ে। লোকমুখে শুনেছি “<strong>ওমিক্রন কভিড</strong>” এর কারণে নাকি সব রাতের ফ্লাইট দিনে নিয়ে আসায় হঠাৎ করেই চাপ বেড়ে গেছে। আমাদের সাথে আসা বাঙ্গালিদের বেশিরভাগ পড়তে বা লিখতে পারেন না। নিজের চোখে দেখেছি স্বাস্থ্য সংক্রান্ত বা ইমিগ্রেশন অফিসাররা এই বাঙ্গালিদের ফর্ম নিজেরা পূরন করে দিচ্ছেন, তাতে প্রতি জনের জন্য অনেক বেশি অতিরিক্ত সময় লাগছে। এই খেটে খাওয়া বাঙ্গালির জন্য যদি অতিরিক্ত সময় লাগে, তবে আমি তাই সই। আরেকটা মজার জিনিষ দেখেছি - এক একটা ব্যুথের লাইন তো বিশাল - সেখানে কেউ লাউন ভেঙ্গে আগাতে চাইলে লোকজন হইহই করে; তাও লাইনে কেউ না কেউ ঢুকে যায়। তবে মহিলারা কেউ আগাতে চাইলে লোকজন আবার যায়গা ছেড়ে দেন, বলেন, “<em>যান যান, আগায় যান, আপনারা আগে শেষ করে ফেলেন</em>“। খেটে খাওয়া মহিলাদের প্রতি খেটে খাওয়া পুরুষদের এইটুকু শ্রদ্ধা চোখে পড়ার মতো।</p>

<p><strong>এরাইভাল ইমিগ্রেশন</strong>:  ছোট দুইটা সমস্যা হয়েছে। একটা হচ্ছে এরাইভালের ফর্ম শেষ হয়ে গিয়েছিলো। অফিসারকে জিজ্ঞাসা করতেই উনি বললেন ডিপারচারের ফর্ম নিয়ে কেটে এরাইভাল লিখে দিয়ে দিতে। উনার হাতে অবশ্য আর কিছু করার ছিলোও না - এরাইভাল ফর্ম তো আর উনি নিয়ে বসে থাকবেন না। আরেকটা হচ্ছে আমার পাসপোর্ট থেকে তথ্য খুঁজে পাচ্ছিলেন না; কারণ ঐটার আগের পাসপোর্ট দিয়ে নাকী আমার তথ্য ঢুকানো হয়েছিলো। কী একটা অবস্থা!</p>

<p><strong>কাস্টমস</strong>: আমি বলেছি ভাই, কতক্ষন লাগবে? কী করতে হবে? আমাকে পাল্টা প্রশ্ন: কই থেকে এসেছেন? আমি: আমেরিকা থেকে। অফিসার বললেন, “<em>দেখেন, কিছু মনে করিয়েন না; বাংলাদেশে বেশিরভাগ মদ বিদেশ থেকে নিয়ে আসেন শিক্ষিত বাঙ্গালিরাই, তারা কাস্টমস এ ডিক্লেয়ারও করেন না। আপনি কাস্টমস এ লাগেজ চেক করতে দেন, মদ না থাকলে ১০ সেকেন্ডে আপনাকে ছেড়ে দিচ্ছি। সোনা আছে ১০০ গ্রামের বেশি?</em>” আমি, “একদমই না!”। আর কোন কথা নাই, ১০ সেকেন্ডে লাগেজ স্ক্যান করেই ছেড়ে দিলো।</p>

<p>সবমিলিয়ে আমার মনে হয়েছে বিমানবন্দর যথেষ্ট উন্নত, আর মানবিক। আরো কিছু হয়তো লোক নেয়া যায় শুধুমাত্র ফর্ম ফিলাপ করার জন্য - তা না হলে অফিসারদের উপরে চাপ অনেক  বেশি পড়ে যায়, সময়ও সবমিলিয়ে বেশি লাগে।</p>

<h2 id="থানা">থানা</h2>

<p>থানায় গিয়ে আমার একটু মন খারাপ লেগেছে। অন্ধকার, গুমোট, ভ্যাপসা গরম একটা পরিবেশ এই ডিসেম্বেরেও। কিন্তু ডিউটি অফিসার আমাক যথেষ্ট সাহায্য করেছেন জিডি করার জন্য, আমি থাকাকালীন সময়ে যারা এসেছেন তাদের সবাইকেও করেছেন - এর মধ্যে এক ইনফরম্যান্টও ছিলো! “<em>স্যার স্যার! আপনারা যেই কিরিমনালরে খোঁজতেছিলেন হ্যায় আসছে বাসায়! খবর পাক্কা!</em>” - মজাই লেগেছে এসব দেখে। আশা করি থানার পরিবেশ আরো ভালো হবে ভবিষ্যতে, ডিউটি অফিসাররাও ভালো পরিবেশ পাবেন।</p>

<h2 id="নির্বাচন-অফিস">নির্বাচন অফিস</h2>

<p>নির্বাচন অফিসে গিয়ে একটু গোত্তা খাওয়া লেগেছে। এক ভবনেই যে দুই এলাকার নির্বাচন অফিস এটা আমি জানতাম না। কাজেই প্রথমে এক অফিসে গেছি, সেখান থেকে আরেক অফিস। অফিসের লাইনে কিছুক্ষন অপেক্ষা করতে করতে দেখলাম ওখানের অফিসাররা কাজ করছেন, যথেষ্ট আন্তরিক। এক বয়স্ক লোক অনেক কথা বলছিলেন কার্ড উঠানোর সময়, ওদিকে কাজগপত্র ঠিক নাই। বেচারা অফিসার না পারে কিছু বলতে, না পারে সইতে। এ অবস্থায় একসময় বলেই ফেললেন, “<em>মুরুব্বী, আমি তো আপনারটাই দেখতেছি - আমারে একটু দেখতে দ্যান?</em>“।</p>

<p>অবশ্য তার পরে সেখান থেকে জেনেছি আমার এলাকার নির্বাচন অফিস নাকি আরেক যায়গায়! সেখানে পরে আরেকদিন গিয়ে স্মার্ট কার্ড উঠিয়েছি। তবে এই অফিস বনেদী এলাকায় হলেও (মতিঝিল) অফিসের অবস্থা ছিলো তথৈচব - ধূলোময়, জীর্ণ দেয়াল মন খারাপ করিয়ে দেয়। নির্দেশনামূলক ব্যানার ছিলো না। তবে প্রিন্ট করা কিছু কাগজে ছিলো কোন কাজের জন্য কত নং টেবিলে যেতে হবে; যদিও টেবিলগুলোতে কোন নাম্বার আমি দেখিনি। কাজগুলোর জন্য যে কী লাগে, কী নিয়ে আসতে হয় তাও লেখা ছিলো না বলে অফিসারদের কাছ থেকে জেনে আবার অনেককেই সেই কাগজ যোগাড় করতে অন্য যায়গায় যেতে দেখেছি।</p>

<h2 id="পাসপোর্ট-অফিস">পাসপোর্ট অফিস</h2>

<p>আমার পাসপোর্ট অফিস কেরাণীগঞ্জে। আমি তো চিন্তায় ছিলাম - ঐদিকের পাসপোর্ট অফিসে যাওয়ার রাস্তা পুরোই ভাঙ্গা, বিচ্ছিরি। দুই তিন বছর আগে নাকি আমার বাবা মায়ের যেতেই ৩ ঘন্টার মতো লেগেছে ভাঙ্গা রাস্তায়। সুতরাং তাড়াহুড়ো করে বার হয়েছি। ওমা, পুরো ১০ কিমি রাস্তা পার হলাম ১০-১৫ মিনিটে, কোথাও জ্যাম নাই। ফ্লাইওভারে উঠেছি আর নেমেছি। আমার বাবা একটু পর পরই বলছিলো, এইটা কী! পুরাই বিদেশের রাস্তা! আমিও দাঁত কেলিয়ে ছিলাম পুরো রাস্তা!</p>

<p><strong>এই একটা মাত্র যায়গায় আমার পরিচয় দিতে বাধ্য আমি, এবং দিয়েছি</strong>। ঢাকা বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ের শিক্ষক হিসাবে পাসপোর্ট রিনিউ করানোর জন্য NoC দিতে হয়। এখানের অফিসাররা অবশ্য একটু অনভিজ্ঞ, কারণ NoC থাকলে কিছু সুবিধা থাকে পাসপোর্ট পাওয়ার জন্য (ডিফল্ট ডেলিভারি মেথড এক্সপ্রেস হয়ে যায়) তবে ঐ অফিসের অফিসার সেটা জানতেনই না। কাজেই আমার পাসপোর্টের ডেলিভারি রেগুলার হবে। একই দিনে আমার আরেক সহকর্মী অবশ্য আগারগাঁও এর পাসপোর্ট অফিসে অবশ্য এক্সপ্রেস ডেলিভারির তারিখই পেয়েছেন।</p>

<p><strong>আপডেট:</strong> আমি পাসপোর্ট তৈরি হয়েছে এসএমএস পাবার দুই দিন পরেই পাসপোর্ট অফিসে গিয়ে ডেলিভারি স্লিপ দিয়ে পাসপোর্ট তুলে নিয়েছি। ডেলিভারি স্লিপ দিয়ে পাসপোর্ট নিতে একটু সময় লাগে, অনেকেই লাইনে থাকেন বলে - কিন্তু ঐ সময় লাগা বাদে আর কিছু লাগেনি। 😄</p>

<h2 id="সবমিলিয়ে">সবমিলিয়ে</h2>

<p>সবমিলিয়ে আমার মনে হয়েছে দেশের সার্ভিসগুলো এখন যথেষ্ট ভালো হয়েছে। ওয়েবসাইটে নির্দেশিকা তো থাকেই, সাথে অফিসগুলোতেও যথেষ্ঠ পরিমাণ নির্দেশিকা টাঙ্গানো, ঝুলানো, বা সাঁটানো থাকে পোস্টারে, কাগজে বা আঁকুনিতে। সিঙ্গাপুরের ভ্রমনকাহিনীতে লিখেছিলাম, হয়তো পড়েছেন আপনি, ওখানেও একই জিনিষ লক্ষ্য করেছি। সকল নির্দেশিকা লেখা থাকে, কাজেই কী করা লাগবে এটা নিয়ে কারো কোন অজ্ঞতা থাকে না। লোকজন নির্দেশিকা অনুসারে কাজ করলেই হয়ে যায়, অন্য ঝামেলার বালাই নেই।</p>

Final update: On Oct 8th, the Display went poof and I had to take it to an Apple Support. There, I learned that some of the Macbooks of this particular model have bad battery and bad keyboard, and replacing both the top case (with the battery) and keyboard will fix this. So after a few days, I got the Macbook back with replaced hardware, and I have not faced any issue ever since.
</div>

<p>I will admit that I have never been a fan of the Apple Eco-System. Well, I love the iPad, and combined with the iPad pencil it is awesome for research, annotation, taking notes, and every conceivable thing you can think of that you want to do on a tablet.</p>

<p>However, my relation with MacBook Pro 2019 13 inch is not that good. Allow me to be more specific: The OSX itself is good (Except <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Preview</code>, a core software, is <a href="https://amitsealami.com/blog/2020/09/08/use-skim-not-preview/">buggy and sucks for PDF</a>). It is an excellent balance between Linux and Windows in terms of offering software and services. Like, most of the software available for Windows is also offered for OSX, and its terminal/libraries work similarly to Linux (at least from my understanding). I have several specifics complaints regarding the hardware though.</p>

<h2 id="the-keyboard-sucks">The Keyboard sucks</h2>

<p>There is no <em>“if, else, but, however,”</em> in the entire universe that can justify the introduction of Butterfly keyboard thing (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/4/21246223/macbook-keyboard-butterfly-magic-pro-apple-design">an example article about this by the Verge</a>). It sucks in terms of feeling when you type, and it is too … fragile. I have been using a keyboard cover from day 1 because I have seen that some MacBooks of the same model simply stopped working because of a dust particle that got under one key.</p>

<h2 id="the-touch-bar-sucks">The Touch bar Sucks</h2>

<p>Well, it has its uses. I like to use it for changing volume, brightness, annotation color - all those fancy things that you can use touch bar. Except when the touch bar is buggy. Arbitrarily, the touch bar disappears. Here is the fun part though:</p>

<h3 id="ludicrous-touch-bar-bug">Ludicrous Touch bar Bug</h3>

<p>When the touch bar bugs out and disappears, so do the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Esc</code> button and the entire group of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">media</code> keys / <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Fn</code> keys. Running something and want to move focus away from it? No <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Esc</code> Button for you buddy. Want to change brightness? Tough luck! You can not unless you do it from the top taskbar thing. Want to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Fn</code> Keys or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Media</code> keys? Find some external keyboard, because no way you can do it (unless you use an onscreen keyboard maybe?)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Surely Restarting MacBook will solve this?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nope. Period.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Update your OSX?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have installed the latest updates. As of writing this, I am using Big Sur - 11.5.2, which is the latest version, <em>today</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What about SMC reset? NVRAM reset?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Based on my personal experience, those may or may not work. MacBook Pro has a mind of its own, I tell you.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How about following these commands I just googled for you?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is the fun part: You will find the following 3 commands on the Internet offered to magically fix the touch bar bug:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span class="c"># command 1</span>
<span class="nb">sudo </span>pkill <span class="s2">"Touch Bar agent"</span>

<span class="c"># command 2</span>
<span class="nb">sudo </span>killall ControlStrip

<span class="c"># command 3</span>
<span class="nb">sudo </span>pkill TouchBarServer</code></pre></figure>

<p>Here is the issue though:</p>

<p>You won’t be able to find <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Touch Bar Agent</code> or anything similar in the running list of processes when it crashes. You can not kill a process that’s already killed. To confirm, I checked the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Preferences &gt; Keyboard</code>. When the bug happens the following 3 items also disappear: a) <em>Touch Bar shows …</em>, b) <em>Show Control Strip</em>, and c) <em>Press and Hold Fn key to …</em>.</p>

<p>So.. there. You are completely at the mercy of the MacBook pro when the touch bar bug happens.</p>

<h3 id="what-triggers-this">What triggers this?</h3>

<p>I have absolutely no idea. I noticed that it happens after a) disconnecting external display, or b) disconnecting air display with iPad, or 3) waking up from Sleep.</p>

<p>In other words, the cause is random/unknown/not faithfully reproducible. Yet, here I am after experiencing it several times in the last few weeks.</p>

<h3 id="possible-solutions---maybe">Possible Solution(s) - Maybe?</h3>

<p>“<em>How about starting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TouchBarServer</code> manually when it crashes?</em>”</p>

<p>That’s an excellent idea, my dear Watson. It may or may not work. I am yet to try it; but just in case - here is the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ps aux</code> for future reference:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span class="nt">-rwxr-xr-x</span>  1 root  wheel   1.9M Jan  1  2020 /usr/libexec/TouchBarServer</code></pre></figure>

<p>So maybe running the following will work. <em>Maybe</em>.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span class="nb">sudo</span> /usr/libexec/TouchBarServer</code></pre></figure>

<div class="warning">
Update September 09, 2021
</div>

<p>It did not work.</p>

<p>“<em>How about starting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ControlStrip</code> manually when it crashes?</em>”</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">/System/Library/CoreServices/ControlStrip.app/Contents/MacOS/ControlStrip</code></pre></figure>
