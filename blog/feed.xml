<h2 id="apple-pencil-20">Apple Pencil 2.0</h2>

<p>This is the only accessory that is not cheap in this list. But guess what? It is well worth the money. There are alternatives out there, but Apple Pencil beats them all when it comes to usability and usefulness.</p>

<h2 id="paper-screen-protector">Paper Screen Protector</h2>

<p>You want to use your pencil on paper, because <em>that’s natural</em>. But, iPad screen is made of glass, made smooth for touch. So, when you want to write notes or draw doodles you probably will experience that the pencil just glides away on the glass protector.</p>

<p>To stop that, you need to use a special screen protector on your glass that introduces juuust the right amount of friction.
Too less, and there is no point using it since it is smooth. Too much, and it will eat your Apple Pencil Nib.
You can replace the nib, but that is not convenient.</p>

<p>I tried several screen protectors till now, and stopped after finding the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08VHPDKDY/">Bellemond Screen protector</a>. Another one I loved using is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07WHNJ9H8/">Mobdik Paperfeel Screen Protector</a>.
Both of them are matte, ofters a paper-like scratchy surface with the right amount of friction and comes cheap - less than $10 per protector.</p>

<div class="warning">
    <i class="material-icons">error_outline</i>
    Before attaching the screen protector, watch their video tutorials. Otherwise, you won't do it right and will ruin it. And don't expect it to be glossy. Scratchy surface is never glossy.
</div>

<h2 id="case-wo-keyboard">Case W/O Keyboard</h2>

<p>After trying out several types of cases for iPad, I stopped after finding keyboard cases with 360 degree hinge.</p>

<p>Roughly, there are two types of cases, a case that has keyboard, and a case that does not have a keyboard.
Fair enough, right?
Among the without keyboard cases I tried, I found the Case with Pencil Holder and Transparent back the most usable.
These type of cases are generally light, the material is soft to protect the iPad from general bumps and drops.
It is also convenient because of the case folding, so you can place the iPad at an angle while reading and/or writing.</p>

<p>When it comes to Keyboard Case, there are several types.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Case has Detachable Keyboard. The case is like a portfolio, so you put the keyboard inside the fold of case when not using. Generally, prices are around $30.</li>
  <li>Case that has keyboard attached and you can use the iPad like a laptop. Kinda like Magic Keyboard from Apple. Prices range from $150 to $250.</li>
  <li>Case that has touchpad and hinge that allows you to position the ipad in versatile ways. Price is around $70.</li>
</ol>

<p>Some of the cases come with touchpad that supports the iOS gestures.</p>

<p>I personally did not like any case with detachable keyboard (Type 1). By design, they are made to be thin to be stored in a portfolio style case. That means the keys need to be soft to support folding and you don’t get that much feedback while typing.</p>

<p>Of course, Type 2 and 3 are the best. At this point, it depends on personal preference. Personally, I found Type 2 to be the most useful after finding <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BL18PN6F/r">TypeCase Touch</a> case. It has a 360 hinge, so you can use your iPad like a laptop, like a iPad, place it at an angle for reading - etc. The keyboard is also solid, and comes with USB-C charger port, so that’s another convenience point for me. Did I mention that this particular case also comes with keyboard backlight with eight colors. If these do not convince you for the Type 3, I don’t know what will.</p>

<p>So, that’s all I use with my iPad.</p>]]></content><author><name>Amit Seal Ami</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just like you, I am a no-nonsense person.

<p>But why a cup? Of this rather peculiar shape?</p>

<!-- more -->
<p>An accompanying card describes it as a Julep Cup.</p>

<p>I learned that there is this Early Southern American tradition of making and gifting such engraved julep cups, usually for special occasions (weddings, births, winning a competition), which dates back to about 200 years ago. People would take it with them while hanging out with family or friends, drinking a mint julep, or something else of choice. It could also be passed on to the next generation as a family heirloom!</p>

<p>This cup was designed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adam_(silversmith)">John Adam of Alexandria</a>, one of the earliest, famous silversmiths. He was also one of the people who recommended and certified the first automatic spoon-crafting machine!</p>

<p>This is a relatively small cup, but with rich historical, and cultural connections.</p>

<p>Thank you VASEM! 🙂</p>]]></content><author><name>Amit Seal Ami</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today I received a gift that relates to Southern American history and culture.

I should mention that I was hosted by the Joint Commission on Technology and Science (JCOTS), Commonwealth of Virginia to work as a Commonwealth of Virginia Engineering and Science - <a href="http://www.vasem.org/covesfellowship/meet-the-2022-fellows/">COVES Policy Fellow</a> from May to August 2022.</p>

<p>I discussed the Cybersecurity issues JCOTS needs to focus on, specifically related to the Internet of Things and NextGen Televisions. Furthermore, I stressed that Policymakers and Researchers need to collaborate more to create better policies for the greater public interest.</p>

<p>The JCOTS Chairman agreed and stressed that JCOTS needs to consider not only public policy creation but also enforcement as I mentioned.</p>

<p>Finally, the JCOTS Chairman on behalf of the Commission thanked me for my contributions.</p>

<p>Personally, I am happy and humbled as the Virginia Academy of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (VASEM) chose me as a COVES Policy Fellow, and JCOTS for hosting me.</p>

Because why not, right? Everyone loves tinkering around the reviewing process instead of actually reviewing, so … there.</p>

<p>Turns out that it is fairly simple to do this programmatically using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">python</code> these days. You need a PyPi packaged called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pypdf2</code> package before, and a template style cornell page that you can generate from <a href="https://incompetech.com/graphpaper/cornelllined/">here</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/pQaQgq2.png" alt="An image with two PDF thumbnail images side by side. The first image shows the PDF version of this website, with an arrow stretching from it to the second image. The second image is of cornel style note page." /></p>

<p>You are golden at this point. Here are the steps:</p>

My goals were simple when making this,</p>

<p>a) learn Python as a programming language and</p>

<p>b) solve a pain point for me.</p>

<p>Turns out that my pain point is also a pain point for other people!</p>

<p>Somehow, it gained attention from nice people across the Internet. It got featured in <a href="https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2017/05/adjust-external-monitor-brightness-ubuntu">OMG Ubuntu</a>, people suggested it on Reddit, and some suggested that it should be <a href="https://pointieststick.com/2021/09/10/this-week-in-kde-a-random-grab-bag-collection-of-stuff/">integrated into KDE</a> by Default or at least they should make something similar. <a href="https://github.com/LordAmit/Brightness/graphs/contributors">Collaborators</a> joined in and helped make Brightness Controller way better than ever possible and helped make this available across Ubuntu PPA, Arch Linux AUR, and more. Just from PPA alone, Brightness Controller has been downloaded about <a href="https://ppa-stats.sheth.io/#/?ppaName=brightness-controller&amp;ppaOwner=apandada1&amp;packageName=brightness-controller">160K times</a>! For all these, I am grateful.</p>

<h2 id="future-of-brightness-controller">Future of Brightness Controller</h2>

<p>People still email me about ideas, suggestions, and new features - such as 1) keyboard shortcuts, 2) setting brightness based on a preset on start-up, 3) making it adjust brightness and color temperature automatically like f.lux or Redshift, 4) making it not be overwritten by f.lux or redshift and 5) finally - making it compatible with Wayland.</p>

<p>Of these, some of them are possible (1-3), and some of them are technically impossible or simply out of my hand (4 and 5). Many of them are good to have.
Indeed, I receive new pull requests implementing new features sometimes. However, progress has slowed down due to the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I use a Macbook for work purposes these days, so even if I can check and run code. Even though PyQt works cross-platform, I can not test the actual Brightness Controlling function enabled by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">xrandr</code>, the backend. It does not work anywhere except Linux, as far as I know.</li>
  <li>More importantly, I have way more on my hands than before!</li>
</ul>

<p>It seems like someone else will have to take up the mantle to do it! 😅</p>

<p>Indeed, I fixed several weird, silly bugs last weekend and completely changed the structure of the project to make it more future-proof when it comes to packaging and publishing. Before that, the last major change happened over a year ago. But that’s okay - Brightness Controller was built with several key design principles in mind. It does not do much, but whatever it is supposed to do, does it well, hopefully.</p>

<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h2>

<p>I am a believer in <em>Less is more</em> and <em>Separation of Concern</em> concepts when it comes to designing and programming.</p>

<p><strong>Separation of Concern (SoC)</strong>: I tried to make sure I follow them when making Brightness Controller. If you look at the code, you will probably notice that it is badly written, long, verbose, and does not follow OOP that well. But it still follows SoC, which has helped me maintain the code base for the last decade. Therefore, if you write code, make sure you follow this principle. 😉</p>

<p><strong>Less is More</strong>: The reason why Brightness Controller works is that it is created to contain no nonsense. I could’ve tried to force in lots of fancy functionalities over time. Do you know what that would mean? More Bugs! No one wants that. Hence, making it simple is better in the long run!</p>

<p><strong>Third Party APIS is a Pain</strong>: Things keep changing outside the scope of Brightness Controller. For example, Wayland will possibly replace <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">xrandr</code>-supported displays soon in Linux entirely, and I do not see anything at this point that can be used as the backend for Brightness Controller in Wayland.</p>

<p><strong>If It ain’t Broken, Don’t Fix it</strong>: Self-explanatory, to be honest. 😉</p>

<p>Anyway, that’s all I wanted to talk about. Have fun people.</p>

<p>Brightness Controller will always be free. Free as in free beer, and free from any type of data tracking whatsoever. Heck, I have no way of knowing how many people are using it right now. It solved my problem, and I hope it solved yours too and <em>gave your eyes some relief</em>.</p>]]></content><author><name>Amit Seal Ami</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[9 Years of Brightness Controller - Experience, Gratitude and Lessons Learned']]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://i.imgur.com/wiz4ZKv.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://i.imgur.com/wiz4ZKv.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry xml:lang="en"><title type="html">Submitting to IEEE/ACM conferences - Lessons Learned</title><link href="https://amitsealami.com/blog/2022/08/29/submitting-to-ieee-acm-conferences-lessons-learned/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Submitting to IEEE/ACM conferences - Lessons Learned" /><published>2022-08-29T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-08-29T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://amitsealami.com/blog/2022/08/29/submitting-to-ieee-acm-conferences-lessons-learned</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://amitsealami.com/blog/2022/08/29/submitting-to-ieee-acm-conferences-lessons-learned/"><![CDATA[<p><em>[Reposting from my old blog site]</em></p>

<p>Recently I faced a few problems for a paper written using ACM conference template. The problems were related to Bibliography, IEEE PDF eXpress and Bookmarks! Here are the details and how I solved them with the help of different materials available across the Internet.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="problem-1-referencing-online-websites-in-bibliography">Problem 1: Referencing Online Websites in Bibliography</h2>

<p>Luckily this was solved in <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/bibtex-formatting">ACM Author Guideline</a>. As mentioned in their website, the structure should be:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@online</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">Thornburg01</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="na">author</span> <span class="p">=</span><span class="s">{Harry Thornburg}</span><span class="p">,</span>

  <span class="na">lastaccessed</span> <span class="p">=</span><span class="s">{March 2, 2005}</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<h2 id="problem-2-url-too-long-and-crosses-references-margin">Problem 2: URL too long and crosses references margin</h2>

<p>For dual column papers, the URL references may be too long, thus ending up crossing the column margin. In ideal scenario, the URL should break to the next line without crossing the margin. To achieve so, I followed instructions from <a href="https://norwied.wordpress.com/2012/07/10/how-to-break-long-urls-in-bibtex/">blog</a>. In short, these packages should be included like so:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span class="k">\usepackage</span><span class="p">{</span>url<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="k">\usepackage</span><span class="p">{</span>breakurl<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="k">\usepackage</span><span class="na">[breaklinks]</span><span class="p">{</span>hyperref<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Sometimes URL contains many dashes ‘-‘ , so he took care of it like so:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span class="k">\def\UrlBreaks</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="k">\do\/\do</span>-<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>As a result, the URL will be broken at an appropriate ‘-‘ when necessary.</p>

<h2 id="problem-3-ieee-pdf-express-checking-failed-due-to-bookmarks-hyperlinks-and-external-hyperlinks">Problem 3: IEEE PDF eXpress checking failed Due to Bookmarks, Hyperlinks and External Hyperlinks</h2>

<p>Well, this was a awkward problem, since I was using the default ACM conference template provided through Overleaf. By default, the template produces PDF files which contain bookmarks. Additionally, each citation becomes hyperlink to references! Whats more, in case the references are to online resources, those references become External Hyperlinks! After digging around, I found the <a href="https://latex.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=69905&amp;sid=94e5b9fd689f20b1ca8c6f57c0e406e4#p69905">answer by Stefan</a> is useful. Particularly, these two options worked for me:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex">  <span class="k">\PassOptionsToPackage</span><span class="p">{</span>draft<span class="p">}{</span>hyperref<span class="p">}</span>
  <span class="k">\hypersetup</span><span class="p">{</span>draft<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Otherwise, the failsafe approach is to use the combination of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pdf2ps</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ps2pdf</code>. For example,</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">  pdf2ps paper.pdf
  ps2pdf paper.ps</code></pre></figure>

<p>This should convert the PDF to PostScript at first, later converting it to PDF again while removing all annotations and bookmarks in the process. Please note that the size of the converted PDF may not match with the original PDF. However, it should still be acceptable to IEEE PDF eXpress.</p>

<p>Good luck with your submissions!</p>]]></content><author><name>Amit Seal Ami</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently I faced a few problems for a paper written using ACM conference template.

Rigorous evaluation? Creative Solutions? Something else entirely?</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/FDE2cCZ.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I recently came across a short paper by Jennifer Rexford and Scott Shenkerand titled “Answering three questions about networking research” that addresses those questions.</p>

<p>I noticed that the concepts discussed in that paper are similar to what I’ve learned as (sub) reviewer. I’ve been sub-reviewing research papers of several Security and Software Engineering venues, such as NDSS, ICSE, USENIX Security, TOSEM, ASE, and FSE, guided by my advisors Dr. Adwait Nadkarni and Dr. Denys Poshyvanyk for the past few years and picked up what to look for, and what not to focus on during reviews.</p>

<p>Next, I raised the following questions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>can I extract and map the properties of good research papers according to this article and my current understanding?</li>
  <li>How do I map the inter-woven relations of these properties in a easily understandable way without repeating texts?</li>
</ol>

<p>I came across the concept of concept mapping recently (see what I did there? Yes? Anyway … ). I am a fan of the mind map technique, and have used it a lot. The concept map technique is similar while labeling relations and following a hierarchical structure.</p>

<p>Based on my understanding, I created the concept map that describes the properties of a good research paper, from the perspective of reviewers.</p>

<p>Does this concept map address the questions I’ve raised, i.e., extracting properties and mapping relations in an easy to understandeable manner?</p>

<p>২০২১ সাল - আমেরিকার কোন এক বিশ্ববিদ্যালয় আয়োজিত গবেষণা আলোচনায় নিমন্ত্রিত বক্তা মুখ লাল করে দাঁড়িয়ে আছেন। তিনি কাজ করেন ফেসবুকে; প্রশ্ন করেছিলেন আলোচনায় অংশ নেয়া বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ের স্নাতক ও স্নাতকোত্তর শিক্ষার্থীদের - যারা নিয়মিত ফেসবুক ব্যবহার করেন তারা যেন হাত তুলে। রুমে ৫০-৬০ জনের মাঝে একজনও হাত তুলে নাই।</p>

<p>আমেরিকায় আমি গবেষণা করছি এবং পিএইচডির পিছনে ছুটছি প্রায় বছর চারেক হচ্ছে। এসময়ে আমি ফেসবুক, ইন্সটাগ্রাম জাতীয় সামাজিক মাধ্যমে দেশি বিদেশি খুব কম সহশিক্ষার্থী আর গবেষকদের একটিভ থাকতে দেখেছি। কারণটা খুব সহজ: গবেষণা করতে একাগ্রতা লাগে, মনোযোগ লাগে, লাগে একনাগাড়ে লেগে থাকা।</p>

<p>আমরা যারা কম্পিউটার সায়েন্সের গবেষণায় আছি - তারা আরো ভালো জানি, ফেসবুক এবং এ জাতীয় সকল মাধ্যমগুলো বিশাল পরিমাণে বিনিয়োগ করে তাদের সিস্টেমে। সেই সিস্টেম প্রতিটা মানুষকে তার পছন্দের কনটেন্ট, ভিডিও ইত্যাদি দেখায়, যেন ব্যবহারকারী আরো মনোযোগ দেয়, আরো সময় দেয়, আরো আরো আরো বেশি জড়িয়ে যায় এসবে।</p>

<p>সমস্যা হচ্ছে এগুলো ব্যবহার করার অভ্যাস আপনার মগজেও পরিবর্তন ঘটায়। কীভাবে এগুলো পাকাপোক্তভাবে আপনার একাগ্রতা নষ্ট করে দেয়, মনোযোগের সময় কমিয়ে আনে এগুলো নিয়ে বিস্তর গবেষণা আছে, হচ্ছে, হবে - সেগুলো নিয়ে আপনি পড়তে পারেন বা শুনতে পারেন অনেক যায়গাতেই। ড: কাল্ নিউপোর্ট, কম্পিউটার সায়েন্স গবেষক, এর <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3E7hkPZ-HTk">একটা ভিডিও</a> বক্তব্য আপনারা শুনতে পারেন যেখানে উনি ফেসবুক জাতীয় মিডিয়াগুলো কীভাবে মানসিক ক্ষতি করে সে বিষয়ে সংক্ষিপ্ত আলাপ করেছেন। ১০টা মিনিট খরচ করে এটা দেখেন, জীবনের কাজে লাগবে অবশ্যই।</p>

<p>মিডিয়ার খারাপ দিক নিয়ে, মনোযোগ অনুশীলন নিয়ে বেশিরভাগ কনটেন্ট যা আছে সেগুলো আমাদের দেশের জন্য প্রযোজ্য না বা প্রয়োগ করাও কঠিন। যেমন কেউ আমাকে যদি বলে ফেসবুক ডিএকটিভ করে ফেলেন - আমি তারে চোখ উল্টায়ে বলবো অসম্ভব! আমার বাবা মা দেশে থাকে, আত্মীয় স্বজনও নানা দেশে, বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ের শিক্ষকদের গ্রুপও ফেসবুকে। সেখানে নানা জরুরী খবর মাঝে মাঝেই থাকে। না পেলে আমারই তো ক্ষতি! তার উপর ফেসবুক ছিলো বলে আমি সময়মতো জানতে পেরেছি <a href="https://amitsealami.com/blog/2021/12/14/Traveling-Bangladesh-Omicron/">হুট করে বাংলাদেশের নিয়ম পাল্টেছিলো ওমিক্রনের জন্য</a> - ফেসবুক না থাকলে দেশে আসার পরে তো আমার বউসহ ১৪ দিন কোয়ারান্টাইনে থাকা লাগতো নিজ খরচে। ক্যামনে কী!?</p>

<p>সুতরাং আমি আলাপ করবো আমি নিজে যা করি মনোযোগ আর একাগ্রতা ধরে রাখতে - ফেসবুক সহ নানা সোশ্যাল মিডিয়াতে থেকে, সাদা কালোর মাঝের ছাই রঙা এই পৃথিবীতে। আপনি হয়তো সবগুলো হুবহু করতে পারবেন না, হয়তো আরো বেশি করতে পারবেন।</p>

<p>এই গাইডলাইনটা থাকলো - আপনার আমার রেফারেন্সের জন্য।</p>

<p>এইটুকু মনে রেখে আমি পরের কাজগুলো করি।</p>

<p>ভ্যাজাল হচ্ছে ছোটবেলায় বাবা মা খুব বেশি সময় টিভি দেখলে বকাঝকা দিয়ে উঠিয়ে দিতো। বড় হবার পরে সোশ্যাল মিডিয়ার জন্য সেটা কে করবে? এ্যালার্ম দিতে আলসেমি লাগে, আবার সবসময় তো ঘড়ি ধরে দেখাও যায় না। তাই না?</p>

<p>দেখাচ্ছি ক্যামনে করি:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>ব্রাউজার প্রোফাইল</strong>: ব্রাউজারে আমার দুইটা প্রোফাইল। একটা কাজের, আরেকটা অকাজের। কাজের প্রোফাইলে আবার অকাজের কোন সাইটে আমি লগইন ই করি নাই। সুতরাং চাইলেও ওটা থেকে আমি অকাজের সাইটে সময় দিতে পারবো না। ক্রোম ব্রাউজারে প্রোফাইল সেটআপ করার জন্য এই <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2364824?hl=en&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop">অফিশিয়াল গাইডলাইন</a> দেখতে পারেন। <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-remove-switch-firefox-profiles">ফায়ারফক্স</a> বা অন্য ব্রাউজারেও একই সুবিধা আছে। ব্রাউজারে না পারলে নিজের কম্পিউটারে দুইটা ইউজার বানিয়ে ফেলেন!</li>
  <li><strong>সময় নিয়ন্ত্রন</strong>: অকাজেরটায় আবার <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stayfocusd/laankejkbhbdhmipfmgcngdelahlfoji/related?hl=en">StayoFocusd</a> নামের একটা এক্সটেনশন ইন্সটল করেছি। আপনিও পারবেন ক্রোম বা এ জাতীয় ব্রাউজারে এটা ইন্সটল করতে। ফায়ারফক্সের জন্যও একই রকম অ্যাপ বা এক্সটেনশন আছে। এটায় আমি কনফিগারেশন করে রেখেছি এভাবে: সারাদিনে আমি যখনই ফেসবুক বা অন্য ব্ল্যাকলিস্টেড সাইট চালাই - এটা সবগুলো সাইট মিলিয়ে আমাকে সর্বমোট ১০ মিনিট দেখতে দিবে। সুতরাং হয়তো আমি ফেসবুক চালাবো ৫ মিনিট, ইন্সটাগ্রাম চালাবো ৫ মিনিট। এর বেশি হলে সারাদিনের জন্য ঐসব সাইট ব্লকড হয়ে যাবে নিজে নিজেই।</li>
  <li><strong>আনইন্সটল ব্লক করা</strong>: যদি নেহাৎ এমন অবস্থা হয় যে আপনি নিজেকে নিজেই নিয়ন্ত্রন করতে পারেন না, দুমদাম সব আনইন্সটল করে ব্রাউজ করতে চান; সেক্ষেত্রে একটা ফ্রি অ্যাপ আছে, <a href="https://getcoldturkey.com/features/">Cold Turkey</a> যেটা আনইন্সটল করাও ব্লক করে দেয়। আরো কিছু অ্যাপ আছে যেগুলো কিনতে হয় টাকা দিয়ে। এটা দিয়ে চেষ্টা করতে পারেন। তবে তার আগে ভেবে দেখবেন, আপনি যদি নিজেই নিজের ভবিষ্যৎ সত্ত্বাকে আটকাতে না পারেন, অ্যাপগুলো কি পারবে?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="pomodoro-আর-নিজেকে-মনিটর-করা">Pomodoro আর নিজেকে মনিটর করা</h3>

<p><strong>Pomodoro</strong>: আমি পোমোডোরো টেকনিকের ভক্ত। যে কাজ করতে ভাল্লাগে না সে কাজ একমনে জন্য পোমোডোরো কাজে দেয় আমার; আর যে কাজ করা দরকার, ভাল্লাগে সেগুলো তো করার জন্য পোমোডোরো লাগে না। করতেই থাকি, করতেই থাকি!</p>

<p>খুব সহজে বললে পোমোডোরো টেকনিক এভাবে প্রয়োগ করি আমি:</p>

<ol>
  <li>কাজটা কী ঠিক করি</li>
  <li>স্টপ ওয়াচ বা টাইমার নিয়ে বসি (না থাকলে <a href="https://pomofocus.io/">ব্রাউজারেই</a> আছে; অথবা মোবাইলে <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cc.forestapp">Forest</a>)</li>
  <li>২৫ মিনিট একাগ্র চিত্তে, একমনে অন্য কিছু না করে খালি ঐ কাজটাই করি</li>
  <li>৫ মিনিট বিরতি - এসময়ে ফেসবুক বা অন্য যা মন চায় করতে পারি</li>
  <li>আবারো ২৫ মিনিট কাজ</li>
  <li>আবারো ৫ মিনিট বিরতি</li>
  <li>আবারো ২৫ মিনিট কাজ</li>
  <li>এবার ১৫ মিনিট বিরতি</li>
  <li>এক নাম্বার স্টেপ থেকে আবারো</li>
</ol>

<p>এমন না যে ঠিক ২৫ মিনিটই কাজ করতে হবে। হয়তো কাজটা মাঝে থামানো যাবে না এজন্য ৩০ মিনিট করতে হতেই পারে! কিন্তু ৫ মিনিট বিরতি মানে ৫ মিনিটই, এর বেশি এক সেকেন্ডও না। আমি টাইমারের টিক্ টিক্ ঘড়ির শব্দটা শুনি। আগে থেকেই এভাবে টিক্ টিক্ শব্দের মাঝে কাজের অভ্যাস বলে শব্দটা শুনলেই নিজে নিজে কাজ করার মানসিকতা চলে আসে।</p>

<p><strong>নিজেকে মনিটর করা</strong>: আমি অনেক সময় মন অস্থির থাকলে পাশে একটা কাগজ কলম রাখি। কাজের মাঝে অন্য কিছু করলে বা ভাবলেই কাগজে লিখে ফেলি সেটা কী।  তারপরে আবার আগের কাজে ফেরত আসি। লিখলে কয়েকটা কাজ হয় -</p>

<p>১) সচেতন হই, নিজের মনোযোগ আবার কাজের বিষয়ে নিয়ে আসতে পারি;</p>

<p>২) সেটা যদি আসলেই কাজের কাজ হয় তাহলে আর মনে করা লাগে না। লেখাটা পড়ে কাজটা করে ফেলি; আর</p>

<p>৩) মনোযোগ কীসে চলে যাচ্ছে সেটা লিখিত আকারে থাকে। সপ্তাহ বা মাস শেষে সেগুলো দেখে আরো পদক্ষেপ নিতে পারি যেন আমার কাজে এগুলো ঝামেলা না করে।</p>

<p>এগুলো ছাড়াও আমি দুইটা জিনিষ সব সময় মনে রাখি বা মানার চেষ্টা করি:</p>

<h3 id="বিশ্রাম-মানে-বিশ্রাম-সোশ্যাল-মিডিয়া-ঘাঁটানো-না">বিশ্রাম মানে বিশ্রাম! সোশ্যাল মিডিয়া ঘাঁটানো না</h3>

<p>দেখেন, অনেকের ধারণা দিনশেষে একটু মোবাইল গুঁতালে, মিডিয়া ঘাটলে মানসিক শান্তি লাগে, বিশ্রাম হয়। ব্যাপারটা তা না। আপনি কাজের সময়ও যেমন তথ্য নিচ্ছেন, আর সেগুলো মানসিক ভাবে বিশ্লেষন করে ক্লান্ত হচ্ছেন - ফেসবুক ঘাটার সময়েও তাই। খালি আপনার ভাল্লাগে বলে টের পান না, যদিও ভিতরে ভিতরে ঠিকই অস্থিরতা বাড়ে, বাড়ে মানসিক পরিশ্রমও।</p>

<p>একারণেই আমার সারাদিনে (বিশ্রাম + কাজের) মাঝে সর্বমোট বরাদ্দ সময় ৪০ মিনিট ফেসবুক এবং অন্য মিডিয়া মিলিয়ে। কারণটা খুব সহজ। দিনশেষে আমি যখন মানসিক ভাবে ক্লান্ত আমি তখন চুপচাপ বসে থাকবো, চিন্তা করবো, গল্প করবো, বা হয়তো বই পড়বো। এগুলোর প্রতিটা আমার নিয়ন্ত্রনে: আমি কতক্ষন করবো। ফেসবুক বা মিডিয়া সেটা ধরে রাখার চেষ্টা করবে। কিছু জিনিষ দেখাবে যেগুলো আমার ভালো লাগবে, কিছু আমাকে দুঃচিন্তা দিবে, কিছু রাগাবে। কিন্তু সেগুলোর নিয়ন্ত্রন আমার হাতে নাই।</p>

<h3 id="সোশ্যাল-মিডিয়া-ছাড়া-সময়-কাটানো-যায়">সোশ্যাল মিডিয়া ছাড়া সময় কাটানো যায়</h3>

<p>সোশ্যাল মিডিয়ার বয়স ২০ বছরও হয়তো হবে কোনমতে। খালি খ্রিষ্টিয় বছর গোনার হিসাবেই মানবজাতির ইতিহাস ২০০০+ বছর। তখন মানুষ সময় কাটাতে পারতো, এখনো পারে। আমিও পারবো। খালি দরকার একটু চেষ্টা, একটু সদিচ্ছা (আর উপরের সবগুলো কাজ করা)। সবসময় সময় কাটানো লাগবে এমনও তো না! কী হয় একটু বিশ্রাম নিলে? একটু নিজের জগতে সময় দিলে? আমার নিজেরই লাভ হবে তাতে।</p>

<h2 id="শেষ-কথা">শেষ কথা</h2>

<p>দিনশেষে অনুশীলন অভ্যাসের বিষয়। আপনি ছোটবেলায় হাঁটতে পারতেন না, সেটা অনুশীলন করে শিখেছেন। এখন আমাকে ৫ কিমিঃ দৌঁড়াতে বললে আমি ১ কিমিঃও হয়তো দৌঁড়াতে পারবো না, হাঁপিয়ে যাবো - কারণ অনুশীলন নাই। একাগ্রতা, মনোযোগ এগুলোও অনুশীলনের বিষয়, খাদ্যাভাস এর মতোই।</p>

<p>এগুলো প্রথম দিন থেকেই হুট করে হবে না, আর আপনি সারাদিনে ২০ মিনিট মেডিটেশন করে একাগ্রতার অভ্যাস করলে সেটা বাকি ১২ ঘন্টা যে অমনোযোগী থাকেন সেটাও ঠিক করবে না। এগুলো আপনার সারাদিনই করা লাগবে, সবসময়ই।</p>

<p>প্রিয় পাঠক/পাঠিকা, হয়তো এগুলোর সবগুলোই আপনি করেন। হয়তো আপনার পরিস্থিতি এমন যে এগুলো করা সম্ভব না। বা হয়তো কোনটা কোনটা আপনি করেন, কোনটা করেন না, পছ্ন্দ না বলে। আমি জানতে চাই, আলাপ করতে চাই এসব নিয়ে। অপেক্ষায় রইলাম আপনার মন্তব্য, প্রশ্নের, সমালোচনার - হোক সেটা এই ব্লগেই, বা ফেসবুকে, বা অন্যখানে।</p>

<p>একাগ্রতার অনুশীলনে আপনার জন্য শুভকামনা। :sunflower:</p>]]></content><author><name>Amit Seal Ami</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[কেউ আমাকে যদি বলে ফেসবুক ডিএকটিভ করে ফেলেন - আমি তারে চোখ উল্টায়ে বলবো অসম্ভব!]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://amitsealami.com/blog/images/default_bn.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://amitsealami.com/blog/images/default_bn.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry xml:lang="en"><title type="html">Traveling to Bangladesh during Omicron Covid: A Tale of Mismanaged Restrictions</title><link href="https://amitsealami.com/blog/2021/12/14/Traveling-Bangladesh-Omicron/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Traveling to Bangladesh during Omicron Covid: A Tale of Mismanaged Restrictions" /><published>2021-12-14T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-12-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://amitsealami.com/blog/2021/12/14/Traveling-Bangladesh-Omicron</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://amitsealami.com/blog/2021/12/14/Traveling-Bangladesh-Omicron/"><![CDATA[<p>The travel regulations <strong>before December</strong> stated 2 conditions: any traveler needs to have 1. double shot of vaccines, and 2. a negative covid result from a test administered within <strong>72 hours before the flight</strong> to avoid getting quarantined. In almost every other nation that’s doable if you consider antigen-testing, or PCR testing, including the USA. Everything checked out for us, and we scheduled PCR Test at CVS Pharmacy. CVS Pharmacy was recommended by almost everyone I knew due to their consistent turnaround time: <a href="https://cvshealth.com/covid-19/testing-information#drive-thru-testing">48-72 hours on average</a>.</p>

<p>Lady Luck had something else in store for us.</p>

<p>At 2AM in US time on the day we were supposed to be tested (December 3rd), we found out that Bangladesh started requiring <a href="https://m.facebook.com/AirportMagistrates/photos/a.691289464302727/4507937399304562/?type=3&amp;source=57">“Covid-negative PCR test result possession for all incoming flight passengers”</a>, within <strong>48 hours before the flight</strong> because of the Omicron variant.</p>

<p>We were <strong>VERY</strong> <strong>CONFUSED</strong>.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>1st, this was apparently declared a couple of days ago, but we found about it much later. I kept checking for travel advisories from Bangladesh and Qatar Airways for the last few days continuously, so I should’ve noticed this earlier. Comments by other Bangladeshis in the Facebook post and the page revealed that this circular was not updated to Civil Aviation Authority Bangladesh’s website even on Dec 3rd, 11:15 AM Bangladesh time, which explains why I did not notice this earlier.</p>

<p>2nd, this is seriously problematic for International Arrivals in Bangladesh during Winter holidays, in particular from the USA, for several reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Only Relying on PCR Tests</strong>: While other countries like <a href="https://www.lufthansa.com/be/en/corona-tests">Germany accepts PCR/Antigen tests</a>, Bangladesh only accepts PCR test. Note that Antigen test results are made available within several hours, while PCR tests generally require 48-72 hours.</li>
  <li><strong>Inconclusive Results from Test</strong>: CVSPharmacy is consistent when returning results within 48 hours, yes - but the result itself can be inconclusive. In fact, a Bangladeshi I know tested Inconclusive in PCR test for 2 days in a row and had to rely on antigen test for travel.</li>
  <li><strong>Lack of Test Slots</strong>: CVSPharmacy and any other pharmacy have fixed slots for Covid tests per day and if you do not schedule in advance, you either a) won’t get test slots that can give you results in 48 hours before the flight, or b) you will get test slots that can not give you results within the 48 hours time range.</li>
  <li><strong>Lack of Very Rapid PCR Test Labs</strong>: Rapid PCR test results come out in 48-72 hours on average. However, some Test Labs/Centers can give you results within <strong>2-3 hours</strong> instead of Very Rapid PCR Test Labs, in exchange for a very high cost (rapid PCR tests generally cost nothing) since they analyze the samples themselves. The problem is, the USA is <strong>BIG</strong> and <strong>Scattered</strong>. The commonwealth (or you can read it as “state” ) I am in, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia">Virginia</a>, is almost as big as Bangladesh (110K sqKM vs 148K sqKM), and it is only 35th largest. Depending on the area you are in, you may or may not have access to such labs. You may have to drive for several hours, and they may or may not test you depending on whether it is a weekend, whether they have a slot, etc. Do remember that it is the winter holidays season. If you don’t have a car, then it is even worse. Public transport in the USA is bad.</li>
  <li><strong>Very Rapid PCR Labs Are closed on Weekends</strong>: Our flight was on a Sunday, so we had to be tested either by Friday or Saturday. Some labs offer half-day service only on Saturday and remain closed till Monday.</li>
  <li><strong>Influx of Customers</strong>: The 48-72 hours turnaround time from CVSPharmacy assumes that there is no sudden surge of customers. And guess what? December is the holiday season, therefore a surge of customers can happen at any time because they will be traveling.</li>
</ol>

<p>In short, this decision came suddenly with no time for travelers to prepare, and with unrealistic expectations. That’s not just me, you can look at the confused comments from soon-to-be-travelers in <a href="https://m.facebook.com/AirportMagistrates/photos/a.691289464302727/4507937399304562/?type=3&amp;source=57">Magistrates All Airports of Bangladesh</a> page as well. In case you are wondering if we can travel to Bangladesh and “bargain” about our entry, we won’t even get the boarding pass for the flight if we do not satisfy these requirements.</p>

<p>We had to frantically search for Very Rapid PCR Test Lab locations and finally found a lab on Saturday. It cost us <strong>300USD per test</strong>, while results are provided in <strong>around 1 hour</strong>. After that, we were able to travel - although exhausted and annoyed at the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh.</p>

<p>Were these new restrictions necessary? Absolutely! Bangladesh took the right steps to reduce the Omicron spread.</p>

<p>However, the execution itself was flawed. Bangladesh should’ve:</p>

<ol>
  <li>spread the declaration across websites and aviation companies as soon as it became available, and</li>
  <li>included Antigen testing as an acceptable test.</li>
</ol>

<p>(<em>Note that I am entirely ignoring the … rather unpleasant nature of the responses from Magistrates there. In fact, I am grateful because if they did not go out of their way to share this as soon as they got this, we would’ve never known about this in time.</em>)</p>

<p>Will Bangladesh change how it handles such things, maybe in the future?</p>

<p>I am … not sure. Doing things the right way requires empathy, far-sightedness, and multi-cultural understanding. I don’t think many of the officers possess those qualities. After all, if they did, these problems won’t have arisen in the first place.</p>

<p>But one can only hope.</p>

<p><em>Let me know your thoughts on this. Have you given up? Or remain hopeful like me?</em></p>]]></content><author><name>Amit Seal Ami</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Travel to Bangladesh almost turned disastrous due to mismanagement and arbitrary declaration of Omicron Travel Regulations.
