<p>While I have published demonstration track papers previously at ICSE/MobileSoft’18 and ICSE’21, the ESEC/FSE’23 tool demo paper that got accepted is <em>special</em>. Note that both ICSE and FSE are top tier software engineering conferences.</p>

<p>What makes this particular publication unique is the list of authors. Syed Yusuf Ahmed and Radowan Redoy, both 4th/final year students from IIT, University of Dhaka, Bangladesh, are the first authors with me in this paper!</p>

<p>This became possible through the <a href="https://amitsealami.com/blog/2023/04/30/foreign-advisor-IIT/">International Scholar Mentorship program</a> I envisioned, designed, pitched, and implemented last year with support from my advisors, Dr. Adwait Nadkarni and Dr. Denys Poshyvanyk from William &amp; Mary, and my teachers and colleagues at IIT, University of Dhaka - Dr. Kazi Sakib, Dr. Shafiul Alam, and Dr. Ahmedul Kabir. The program allows students to officially work on academic research guided by international scholars for their final, 6-credit Software Engineering project in the Bachelor’s program of IIT.</p>

<p>While it is common for students to collaborate and get involved with academic research unofficially throughout the world, <strong>this is the first program of its type in Bangladesh, especially within the SE/CS discipline, to the best of my knowledge.</strong> As far as I know and remember, this is also the first time an IIT Undergrad student’s first author paper got accepted at any top tier software engineering conference, in any track!</p>

<p>Of course, it became possible through the efforts of Yusuf and Radowan, and the reviews this paper received are testaments to that. It was a pleasure for me to guide both of them directly.</p>

<p>Yusuf will join Purdue University this Fall for his Ph.D., where he plans to work on DL/Security. Radowan had personal goals to achieve this year and aims to go for Ph.D. next year!</p>
