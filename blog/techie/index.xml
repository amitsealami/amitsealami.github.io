You are probably here, pissed off, angry at your NVidia Prime / Optimus Laptop because - It does not allow you to even Try Ubuntu/Kubuntu because it freezes - It throws &amp;ldquo;dell smbios unable to tun on non dell system for installing&amp;rdquo; - You installed Ubuntu/Kubuntu directly by clicking on Install Ubuntu/Kubuntu - but it does not start - You installed Ubuntu/Kubuntu directly by clicking on Install Ubuntu/Kubuntu - but when you login, it shows a black screen with plasma icon, and freezes
Well, welcome to the boat. I went through this hell as well. And this post comes with absolutely no certainty here that it will work.</description></item><item><title>Nesting Hugo Blog in Hugo Site</title><link>https://amitsealami.github.io/blog/techie/nesting-hugo-blog-in-hugo-site/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 May 2018 22:01:09 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://amitsealami.github.io/blog/techie/nesting-hugo-blog-in-hugo-site/</guid><description>Here is the scenario: I wanted to include a blog in this website. That is, the blog http://amitsealami.github.io/blog will be in http://amitsealami.github.io. However, there were a few things I wanted to achieve with it:
The sites will be using different themes, configurations. In short, the parent and blog site will be separately handled. The blog should be AMP enabled The blog should have its own sitemap.xml file which won&amp;rsquo;t be interfering with the original site&amp;rsquo;s sitemap.xml Enabling AMP AMP is actually the easy part, just include an AMP enabled theme. I went for the hugo solit theme.</description></item></channel></rss>
